## Build and Install wrk to Ubuntu

Install building tools.

`sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake y`

Now install `wrk` -

First clone it.

`git clone git@github.com:obakfahad/wrk.git`

Then go to the directory

`cd wrk`

Now,

`make`

`sudo cp wrk /usr/local/sbin/`

Done. :)

## Usage

wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool

  wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
  load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
  design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

  An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response
  processing, and custom reporting. Details are available in SCRIPTING and
  several examples are located in scripts/

Basic Usage

  `wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html`

  This runs a benchmark for 30 seconds, using 12 threads, and keeping
  400 HTTP connections open.

  Output:

  Running 30s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
    12 threads and 400 connections
    Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev
      Latency   635.91us    0.89ms  12.92ms   93.69%
      Req/Sec    56.20k     8.07k   62.00k    86.54%
    22464657 requests in 30.00s, 17.76GB read
  Requests/sec: 748868.53
  Transfer/sec:    606.33MB

### Benchmarking Tips

  The machine running wrk must have a sufficient number of ephemeral ports
  available and closed sockets should be recycled quickly. To handle the
  initial connection burst the server's listen(2) backlog should be greater
  than the number of concurrent connections being tested.

  A user script that only changes the HTTP method, path, adds headers or
  a body, will have no performance impact. Per-request actions, particularly
  building a new HTTP request, and use of response() will necessarily reduce
  the amount of load that can be generated.

### Acknowledgements

  wrk contains code from a number of open source projects including the
  'ae' event loop from redis, the nginx/joyent/node.js 'http-parser',
  and Mike Pall's LuaJIT. Please consult the NOTICE file for licensing
